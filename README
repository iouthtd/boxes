I wrote this program because I wanted to render an animated gif of a stack of boxes getting knocked over.
Box2D provides the physics of the boxes but most everything else is done manually with low-level libraries.

Press the ~ or ยง key (they key below ESC) to open the console.

Commands:
	help - list commands
	blend - Reduces groups of 16 frames into 1 with a weighted average for motion blur.
	framerate <int> - Changes preview framerate. Doesn't affect output.
	load <file.json> - Loads and renders an animation.
	pause - Pauses the preview.
	resume - Resumes paused preview.
	reverse - Reverses the animation.
	save - Saves all frames to output/frame####.bmp.
	quit - Exits the application.

Dependencies:
	Boost
	Box2D
	Cairo
	Configurable Math Library
	SDL2
